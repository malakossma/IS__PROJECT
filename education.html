            <p>
              Gamified learning with AI combines game elements and artificial intelligence to create an engaging and personalized learning experience. 
              Through points, badges, levels, and interactive challenges, students become more motivated to participate and improve their performance.
               AI enhances this process by adapting the difficulty of tasks to the student’s skill level, offering customized hints, and tracking progress in real time. As a result, learners remain focused, enjoy the process, and develop a deeper understanding of the material. This approach makes education more interactive, fun, and effective for all types of students.

            <p>
              Artificial Intelligence plays a transformative role in supporting students
             with special educational needs by providing smart assistive technologies that enhance accessibility.
             Tools based on speech recognition help convert spoken language into written text for hearing-impaired students,
             while text-to-speech systems assist visually impaired learners. These technologies help students overcome learning barriers,
             participate actively in classrooms, and achieve better academic outcomes, promoting more inclusive education.
